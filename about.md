# About

Hi, I'm Alex Bird, and this blog. Welcome, and thank you for being here!  

While I should probably refrain from using the first person pronoun, I have a very strong preference for speaking in person, and old habits die hard. Just for a moment, I would prefer to pretend that we're not meeting through the emotionless medium of a screen, despite the fact that we are, and the fact that we are not really  meeting. To add insult to injury, I cannot really welcome you, since I'm not doing any of the hosting. I must thank Github for that honour. My apologies for this
rather uncongenial experience.

### Who am I?
I'm just finishing up a phd in machine learning (ML) at the Turing Institute (London, UK) and the University of Edinburgh. I'm a bit older than your average phd student, as I spent my (Math) undergraduate more interested in music than mathematics, which continued for a number of years after. Finally capitulating to a 'real job', I worked for 5 years in the data analytics space in credit risk and retail (riding the swell of the data science wave
at that time). Modelling became my new music, and I spent all my free time in my mid/late twenties teaching myself statistics, modelling and how to code. There's a certain magic about machine learning, when applied right. However, there's a lot of machine learning applied wrong, and part of that is due to a nascent or rapidly advancing field. I'm keen to pitch in wherever I can to help expand our collective knowledge about ML, part of that is research, and part of that is dissemination;
a job which (in my view) is most rapidly advanced by blogging, provided that the information is well-founded. I will try my best.

<!-- Clearly the appropriate use of data can be really powerful, and like any technology has tremendous power for good or ill. -->

### What is this?
In this blog[^fastaitemplate] I'm intending to write predominantly about machine learning. At present this will be a summary of some of my phd projects, and some things I've learned which did not make it into papers. Research probably bears some analogy to rejection sampling, especially where little theory is available for guidance (as in ML), and one learns as much through failures (perhaps
more so) than successes. I'm especially interested in making some of my negative results available; while it is difficult to verify these, it may still  give a few pointers to those who set foot along the same paths. 

### Contact
I'm not overly enamoured of social media, and I'm not really contactable there, so I'll work out some way for those who are interested to get in touch. For the time being, you can use {first-letter-of-first-name} {last-name} {at} turing {dot} ac {dot} uk (no spaces), but I'll try to get around to something better soon.

[^benefit]: I'm also aware of the tremendous amount of snake oil at play in the industry.

[^1]: Some areas of ML really are mature, such as those built on the foundations of learning theory (Vapnik et al.), or those bits which are arguably statistics. But I don't think too many would shoot me for saying that most of modern ML is pretty immature.

[^fastaitemplate]: Thanks to fast.ai for the original [template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) [(introductory blog)](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/). I've made some modifications -- so any poor choices remain my own responsibility. No, I'm not using Minimal Mistakes, and yes I know it's excellent.
