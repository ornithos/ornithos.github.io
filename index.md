This is mostly just a single blog post I wrote during my PhD. Nothing much to see here beyond that, but I'm keeping this up in the hope that one day I'll write something else.

If you'll permit some further self-promotion outside of this site, here's a post I wrote on Medium regarding our development of an [open source taxonomy at Quine](https://medium.com/quine/a-taxonomy-of-open-source-software-b3840ac1ef20). The ambition of such a project is not insignificant, and we would love to iterate on it over the course of 2023 (interest permitting); for now I would be grateful for any feedback.
