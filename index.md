I'm a researcher working in machine learning (ML), see [About](about.html). This is my third attempt at a blog. Between the previous attempts, I have about 2/3 of a post, so I'm now taking myself out for a meal everytime I complete one. You'll have to judge for yourself how well this incentive structure is working.
